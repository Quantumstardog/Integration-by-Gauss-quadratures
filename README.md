# Integration-by-Gauss-quadratures
In this project i will share my work related to integration by the gauss quadrature method, comprised of the gauss-legendre, gauss-radau and gauss-lobatto quadratures.
The main alghoritm to obtain the zeros of the polynomial of each quadrature is the classic Newton - Raphson method.
